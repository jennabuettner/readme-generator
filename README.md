# README Generator

This project's purpose is to create a command-line application that accepts a user's input and uses it to generate a high-quality professional README.md.

## Description

This is a command-line application that collects user input to create a README.md. The user is prompted to answer questions in regard to the information about their application repository. They are asked for the title, description, installation instructions, usage, license, technologies, contributing information, tests, and email as well as gitHub username. The application will then generate a professional README file with all of the user's input. It will also create a table of contents that, when a line item is click on, will take the user to that section of their README file.
